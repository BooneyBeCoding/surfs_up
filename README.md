# Surfs_Up Statistical Analysis
Utilizing Jupyter &amp; SQLite

## Overview
With SQLite and SQLAlchemy - analyze W. Avy's file of Hawaii's temperatures for June and December.

## Results
From the below discoveries there are a few main takeaways:

- December had nearly 200 less temperature counts than June (this could lead to a greater Std Deviation).
- Across the board June had higher temps.
- While December did have a higher Std Deviation than June, their temperatures are much closer than one would think.

## Summary
By looking at the statistical summaries for June and December we can see that June had higher temperatures, with June being a summer month it makes snese. In addition, we can see that June's data is a little more reliable since the standard deviation is lower.  My thoughts are that it could be since June has almost 200 more temperature counts than December.  Even though December does have lower temps than June, the temps are much closer than one would imagine December and June being in a less tropical climate.
